Solution :

SELECT SUM(CITY.POPULATION) FROM CITY INNER JOIN COUNTRY ON CITY.COUNTRYCODE = COUNTRY.CODE 
WHERE COUNTRY.CONTINENT = "Asia";

Destructuring Solution : 

SELECT SUM(CITY.POPULATION)
// We have to return the sum of population so we had used function SUM
FROM CITY INNER JOIN COUNTRY
//we want data from both tables so we are using inner join
ON CITY.COUNTRYCODE = COUNTRY.CODE
//on (condition) where our tables are attached
WHERE COUNTRY.CONTINENT = "Asia";
