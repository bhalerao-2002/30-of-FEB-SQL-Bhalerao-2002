Solution : SELECT CASE
            WHEN G.GRADE>=8 THEN S.NAME
            ELSE 'NULL' END , G.GRADE, S.MARKS
            FROM STUDENTS S, GRADES G
            WHERE S.MARKS >= MIN_MARK AND S.MARKS <= MAX_MARK
            ORDER BY G.GRADE DESC, S.NAME, S.MARKS;
            

Destructured Solution : 

SELECT CASE
//we are using case to use if-else condition in SQL
            WHEN G.GRADE>=8 THEN S.NAME //when grade are >= 8 we return name of student 
            ELSE 'NULL' END // else we return NULL instead of name. END the statement 
//this was our first requirement them we need grades column and markes column 
, G.GRADE, S.MARKS
            FROM STUDENTS S, GRADES G
now we need to calculate the grades using following where condition 
            WHERE S.MARKS >= MIN_MARK AND S.MARKS <= MAX_MARK
//Now we want ordered output, 
1. descending order of their grades if they are same
2. asc/alphabetical order of there names, and if names are also same it will happen in case of the null name of student 
3. we will arrenge it by ascending order of their marks.
            ORDER BY G.GRADE DESC, S.NAME, S.MARKS;
