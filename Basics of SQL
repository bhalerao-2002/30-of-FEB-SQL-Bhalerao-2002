## Clauses

In SQL, clauses are utilised to execute specific functions or operations.
It is customary to write clauses in SQL statements using capital letters.
In SQL, clauses can also be referred to as commands as they are used to perform specific actions or operations on the data stored within a database..

e.g., 
CREATE TABLE table_name (
       column_1 data_type,
       column_2 data_type,
       column_3 data_type 
    );

table_name refers to the name of the specific table on which a particular command or operation is being performed.

(column_1 data_type, column_2 data_type, column_3 data_type) are parameters.

A parameter is a set of values, columns, or data types that are provided to a clause as an input argument.

1. CREATE TABLE : To create table in Database.
    CREATE TABLE table_name (
           column_1 data_type,
           column_2 data_type,
           column_3 data_type 
        );

2. INSERT INTO : To append the specified row or multiple rows to a table.
    INSERT INTO student(Student_id,student_Name,Contact_Number)
    VALUES (34,'Abel George',910023432);

3. ALTER : To append a new column to an existing table.
    ALTER TABLE student
    ADD COLUMN Department TEXT default NULL;
While altering the table we can either keep the newly added column blank or we could set a default value (as mentioned above) to it. Lets run the query by adding a default value to the newly added column.

### Note: SELECT * FROM table_name  To print all from table.
